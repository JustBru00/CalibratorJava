# Thermistor Calibrator Java
Thermistor Calibrator is an open source IntelliJ program, that can be used to Calibrate NTC Thermistors. 
## Running
To run this you will need IntelliJ. I have not yet packaged a jar file, so you will need to intall all the libraries yourself, to get it working. 
- Clone the repo.
- Download

	- [Jfree Chart](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jfree/jfreechart/1.0.19/jfreechart-1.0.19.jar)
- Add the modules by going to Files -> Project Structure -> Modules and click the + sign.
